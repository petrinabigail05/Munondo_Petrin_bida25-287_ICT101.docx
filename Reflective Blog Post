REFLECTIVE BLOG POST – ADAPTING TO UNIVERSITY 

At first, I was so excited to start my university education, I came early to school so excited and eager to learn. When school suddenly started, I noticed that university life is not common to senior life where you are forced to do assignments by your teacher, where you are motivated to do your work every time. University life is so different and difficult but easy at the same time, here you must motivate yourself and push yourself into doing schoolwork and submit well on time. For me this was a big challenge as iI was not used to doing anything without supervision but also an important lesson as I learnt that in life if you want to achieve something great you must work hard. 
Also having a few lessons in a week made me think that I have plenty of time without realizing that the time I wasted relaxing, I will eventually need it as time goes by. Managing time was another challenge for me as I was used to being supervised all the time, but I learnt how to manage my time without supervision because without time management nothing will go right. 

As for studying, at first, I used to read whenever I felt like it but after attending a specific module called Communication and Study Skills, I learnt the Pomodoro technique which I tried using and it was hopefully productive to me. If I were to study for 2 hours, I would study for the first 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break between every session. Group discussion also worked most for me, I believe that working together can make people achieve something big. 

At this era, I had mindset growth as I started to believe in myself, at first, I had confidence in math related module only because math is my strength but not theory modules after using the pomodoro technique and group work discussion I started having hope and confidence towards all the modules.
